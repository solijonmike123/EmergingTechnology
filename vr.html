        <h3 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp"><b>What is Augmented Reality?</b></h3>
        <p>Augmented Reality is technology in computer graphics which combines the real time environment with the digital one. 
            In Virtual reality users totally experience new world while in augmented reality digital information display over the real environment. 
            To experience Augmented Reality user need AR headset.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AR overlays digitally created content into the user’s real-world environment.</li>
            <li>An enhanced version of the real physical world that is achieved through the use of digital visual
            elements, sound, or other sensory stimuli and delivered via technology.</li>
            </ul><br><br><hr>
        <h3><b>VIRTUAL REALITY</b></h3>

        <p>Computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional image
        or environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or
        physical way by a person using special electronic equipment, such
        as a helmet with a screen inside or gloves fitted with sensors.Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated environment that can be similar to or completely different from the real world.<b> Here are some examples of virtual reality:</b></p>
<br>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Video Games:</b> One of the most popular uses of VR is in video games. VR headsets allow players to fully immerse themselves in the game environment, creating a more realistic and engaging experience.
            </li><br>
            <li><b>Simulators:</b> VR is also used in simulators for training purposes, such as flight simulators for pilots, driving simulators for new drivers, and medical simulators for healthcare professionals.</li><br>
        <li><b>Education:</b> Virtual reality can be used in education to create immersive learning experiences. For example, students can visit historical sites or explore the human body in 3D.</li><br>
        <li><b>Tourism:</b> Virtual reality can be used to provide virtual tours of places that are difficult or impossible to visit in person, such as underwater reefs, space stations, or foreign countries.</li><br>
        <li><b>Therapy:</b> VR is also used in therapy to treat various mental health conditions, such as anxiety disorders and phobias, by exposing patients to virtual environments that trigger their fears in a controlled setting.</li><br>
   <li><b>Entertainment:</b> VR can be used in entertainment to create immersive experiences for concerts, sporting events, and other live performances.</li><br>
    </ul>
<br><br><hr>
        <h3><b>MIXED REALITY</b></h3>
        <p>
            Mixed reality is a blend of physical and digital worlds, unlocking natural and intuitive 3D human, computer, and environmental interactions. 
            This new reality is based on advancements in computer vision, graphical processing, display technologies, input systems, and cloud computing.Mixed reality (MR) is an immersive experience that combines elements of both virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) to create a new environment where digital and physical objects coexist and interact with each other. <b>Here are some examples of mixed reality:
            </b></p><br>

            <ul>
                <li><b>HoloLens:</b> Microsoft's HoloLens is a mixed reality headset that overlays holographic images onto the real world, allowing users to interact with both physical and virtual objects at the same time.</li><br>
                <li><b>Design and engineering:</b> Mixed reality can be used in design and engineering to create virtual prototypes and simulate how they interact with the real world. For example, architects can use MR to visualize how a building will look in its actual environment.</li><br>
                <li><b>Entertainment:</b> Mixed reality can be used in entertainment to create immersive experiences that combine real and virtual elements. For example, Disney has created mixed reality experiences where guests can interact with digital characters in physical environments.</li><br>
                <li><b>Medical training:</b> Mixed reality can be used in medical training to simulate surgeries and other procedures. For example, doctors can use MR to practice surgeries on virtual patients before performing them on real ones.</li><br>
                <li><b>Manufacturing:</b> Mixed reality can be used in manufacturing to improve productivity and quality control. For example, workers can use MR headsets to see virtual instructions and guidance overlaid onto the physical objects they are working on.</li><br>
                <li><b>Education:</b> Mixed reality can be used in education to create immersive and interactive learning experiences. For example, students can use MR to explore historical sites or scientific concepts in 3D.</li><br>
            </ul>
            <hr>
        <h3><b>Augmented Reality Architecture</b></h3>

            <p>This Architecture comprised of all above components and interactive relationship between them helps to develop augmented reality working model.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>User:</b>  The most essential part of augmented reality is its user. The user can be a student, doctor, employee. This user is responsible for creation of AR models.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Interaction:</b> It is a process between device and user. The word itself consist of its meaning some action perform by one entity as result in creation or some action performed by other entity.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Device:</b> This component is responsible for creation, display and interaction of 3D models. The device can be portal or in static state. Example, mobile, computer, AR headsets etc.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Virtual Content:</b>The virtual content is nothing but the 3D model created or generated by the system or AR application. Virtual content is type of information that can be integrated in real world user’s environment. This Virtual content can be 3D models, texture, text, images etc.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Tracking:</b> This component is basically process which makes possible creation of AR models. Tracking is sort of algorithm which help to determine the device where to place or integrate the 3D model in real world environment. There are many types of Tracking algorithm available which can be used in development of AR applications.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Real-life entity: </b>The last component AR architecture is real world entities. This entities can be tree, book, fruits, computer or anything which is visible in screen. AR application does not change position of real life entity. It only integrate the digital information with this entities.</li><br>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <h3><b>Applications of AR System</b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>AR in Gaming</li>
                <li>AR in Education</li>
                <li>AR in Retail</li>
                <li>AR in Marketing</li>
                <li>AR in Healthcare</li>
