        <h3 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp"><b>What is Nanotechnology?</b></h3>
<br>
           <p><b>Nanotechnology</b> is the understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale, at dimensions between approximately 1 and 100 nanometers, where unique phenomena enable novel applications. Matter can exhibit unusual physical, chemical, and biological properties at the nanoscale, differing in important ways from the properties of bulk materials, single atoms, and molecules. Some nanostructured materials are stronger or have different magnetic properties compared to other forms or sizes of the same material. Others are better at conducting heat or electricity. They may become more chemically reactive, reflect light better, or change color as their size or structure is altered.

            Although modern nanoscience and nanotechnology are relatively new, nanoscale materials have been used for centuries. Gold and silver nanoparticles created colors in the stained-glass windows of medieval churches hundreds of years ago. The artists back then just didn’t know that they were using nanotechnology to create these beautiful works of art!
        
            Nanotechnology encompasses nanoscale science, engineering, and technology in fields such as chemistry, biology, physics, materials science, and engineering. Nanotechnology research and development involves imaging, measuring, modeling, and manipulating matter between approximately 1–100 nanometers.                    
            </p><br><hr>

            <h3><b>Applications of Nanotechnology</b></h3>

            <p>After more than 20 years of basic nanoscience research and more than fifteen years of focused R&D under the NNI, applications of nanotechnology are delivering in both expected and unexpected ways on nanotechnology’s promise to benefit society.

                Nanotechnology is helping to considerably improve, even revolutionize, many technology and industry sectors: information technology, homeland security, medicine, transportation, energy, food safety, and environmental science, among many others. Described below is a sampling of the rapidly growing list of benefits and applications of nanotechnology.</p>
        
                

            
                <h3><b>Everyday Materials and Processes</b></h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nanoscale additives to or surface treatments of fabrics can provide lightweight ballistic energy deflection in personal body armor, or can help them resist wrinkling, staining, and bacterial growth.</li>
                    <li>Clear nanoscale films on eyeglasses, computer and camera displays, windows, and other surfaces can make them water- and residue-repellent, antireflective, self-cleaning, resistant to ultraviolet or infrared light, antifog, antimicrobial, scratch-resistant, or electrically conductive.</li>
                    <li>Nanoscale materials are beginning to enable washable, durable “smart fabrics” equipped with flexible nanoscale sensors and electronics with capabilities for health monitoring, solar energy capture, and energy harvesting through movement.</li>
                    <li>Lightweighting of cars, trucks, airplanes, boats, and space craft could lead to significant fuel savings. Nanoscale additives in polymer composite materials are being used in baseball bats, tennis rackets, bicycles, motorcycle helmets, automobile parts, luggage, and power tool housings, making them lightweight, stiff, durable, and resilient. Carbon nanotube sheets are now being produced for use in next-generation air vehicles. For example, the combination of light weight and conductivity makes them ideal for applications such as electromagnetic shielding and thermal management.</li>
                    <li>Nano-bioengineering of enzymes is aiming to enable conversion of cellulose from wood chips, corn stalks, unfertilized perennial grasses, etc., into ethanol for fuel. Cellulosic nanomaterials have demonstrated potential applications in a wide array of industrial sectors, including electronics, construction, packaging, food, energy, health care, automotive, and defense. Cellulosic nanomaterials are projected to be less expensive than many other nanomaterials and, among other characteristics, tout an impressive strength-to-weight ratio.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
                <h3><b>Electronics and IT Applications</b></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transistors, the basic switches that enable all modern computing, have gotten smaller and smaller through nanotechnology. At the turn of the century, a typical transistor was 130 to 250 nanometers in size. In 2014, Intel created a 14 nanometer transistor, then IBM created the first seven nanometer transistor in 2015, and then Lawrence Berkeley National Lab demonstrated a one nanometer transistor in 2016!  Smaller, faster, and better transistors may mean that soon your computer’s entire memory may be stored on a single tiny chip.</li>
                    <li>Flexible, bendable, foldable, rollable, and stretchable electronics are reaching into various sectors and are being integrated into a variety of products, including  wearables, medical applications, aerospace applications, and the Internet of Things. Flexible electronics have been developed using, for example, semiconductor nanomembranes for applications in smartphone and e-reader displays. Other nanomaterials like graphene and cellulosic nanomaterials are being used for various types of flexible electronics to enable wearable and “tattoo” sensors, photovoltaics that can be sewn onto clothing, and electronic paper that can be rolled up. Making flat, flexible, lightweight, non-brittle, highly efficient electronics opens the door to countless smart products.   </li>
                    <li>Nanoparticle copper suspensions have been developed as a safer, cheaper, and more reliable alternative to lead-based solder and other hazardous materials commonly used to fuse electronics in the assembly process.</li>
                    <li>Ultra-high definition displays and televisions are now being sold that use quantum dots to produce more vibrant colors while being more energy efficient.</li>
                    <li>Other computing and electronic products include Flash memory chips for smart phones and thumb drives; ultra-responsive hearing aids; antimicrobial/antibacterial coatings on keyboards and cell phone casings; conductive inks for printed electronics for RFID/smart cards/smart packaging; and flexible displays for e-book readers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><b>Medical and Healthcare Applications</b></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Commercial applications have adapted gold nanoparticles as probes for the detection of targeted sequences of nucleic acids, and gold nanoparticles are also being clinically investigated as potential treatments for cancer and other diseases.</li>
                    <li>Better imaging and diagnostic tools enabled by nanotechnology are paving the way for earlier diagnosis, more individualized treatment options, and better therapeutic success rates.</li>
                    <li>Nanotechnology is being studied for both the diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerosis, or the buildup of plaque in arteries. In one technique, researchers created a nanoparticle that mimics the body’s “good” cholesterol, known as HDL (high-density lipoprotein), which helps to shrink plaque. </li>
                    <li>The design and engineering of advanced solid-state nanopore materials could allow for the development of novel gene sequencing technologies that enable single-molecule detection at low cost and high speed with minimal sample preparation and instrumentation.</li>
                    <li>Nanotechnology researchers are working on a number of different therapeutics where a nanoparticle can encapsulate or otherwise help to deliver medication directly to cancer cells and minimize the risk of damage to healthy tissue. This has the potential to change the way doctors treat cancer and dramatically reduce the toxic effects of chemotherapy.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3><b>Energy Applications</b></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nanotechnology is improving the efficiency of fuel production from raw petroleum materials through better catalysis. It is also enabling reduced fuel consumption in vehicles and power plants through higher-efficiency combustion and decreased friction.</li>
                    <li>Nanotechnology is also being applied to oil and gas extraction through, for example, the use of nanotechnology-enabled gas lift valves in offshore operations or the use of nanoparticles to detect microscopic down-well oil pipeline fractures. </li>
                    <li>Nanotechnology is already being used to develop many new kinds of batteries that are quicker-charging, more efficient, lighter weight, have a higher power density, and hold electrical charge longer. </li>
                    <li>In the area of energy harvesting, researchers are developing thin-film solar electric panels that can be fitted onto computer cases and flexible piezoelectric nanowires woven into clothing to generate usable energy on the go from light, friction, and/or body heat to power mobile electronic devices. Similarly, various nanoscience-based options are being pursued to convert waste heat in computers, automobiles, homes, power plants, etc., to usable electrical power. </li>
                    <li>Energy efficiency and energy saving products are increasing in number and types of application. In addition to those noted above, nanotechnology is enabling more efficient lighting systems; lighter and stronger vehicle chassis materials for the transportation sector; lower energy consumption in advanced electronics; and light-responsive smart coatings for glass.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3><b>Environmental Remediation</b></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nanotechnology could help meet the need for affordable, clean drinking water through rapid, low-cost detection and treatment of impurities in water. </li>
                    <li>Engineers have developed a thin film membrane with nanopores for energy-efficient desalination. This molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) membrane filtered two to five times more water than current conventional filters.</li>
                    <li>Nanoparticles are being developed to clean industrial water pollutants in ground water through chemical reactions that render the pollutants harmless. This process would cost less than methods that require pumping the water out of the ground for treatment.</li>
                    <li>Many airplane cabin and other types of air filters are nanotechnology-based filters that allow “mechanical filtration,” in which the fiber material creates nanoscale pores that trap particles larger than the size of the pores. The filters also may contain charcoal layers that remove odors. </li>
                    <li>Nanotechnology-enabled sensors and solutions are now able to detect and identify chemical or biological agents in the air and soil with much higher sensitivity than ever before. Researchers are investigating particles such as self-assembled monolayers on mesoporous supports (SAMMS™), dendrimers, and carbon nanotubes to determine how to apply their unique chemical and physical properties for various kinds of toxic site remediation. Another sensor has been developed by NASA as a smartphone extension that firefighters can use to monitor air quality around fires.</li>

                <h3 ><b>What is Biotechnology?</b></h3><br>
                <p><b>Biotechnology</b> is technology based on biology - biotechnology
                    harnesses cellular and biomolecular processes to develop
                    technologies and products that help improve our lives and the health
                    of our planet. We have used the biological processes of
                    microorganisms for more than 6,000 years to make useful food
                    products, such as bread and cheese, and to preserve dairy
                    products.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Today, biotechnology covers many different disciplines (e.g.
                    genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, etc.). New technologies
                    and products are developed every year within the areas of e.g.
                    Medicine (development of new medicines and therapies), agriculture
                    (development of genetically modified plants, biofuels, biological
                    treatment) or industrial biotechnology (production of chemicals, paper,
                    textiles, and food).</p><hr>
                    <br>
        <br>
        <h3><b>History Of Biotechnology</b></h3><br>
        <p>When Edward Jenner invented vaccines and when
            Alexander Fleming discovered antibiotics, they were
            harnessing the power of biotechnology. And, of course,
            modern civilization would hardly be imaginable without the
            fermentation processes that gave us beer, wine, and
            cheese
            
            When he coined the term in 1999. Agriculturalist Karl
            Ereky described ‘biotechnology’ as “all lines of work by
            which products are produced from raw materials with the
            aid of living things.”</p>

                        <h3 ><b>What is Blockchain?</b></h3><br>
                        <p>Originally <em>Blockchain</em> is a growing list of records, called blocks,
                            that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a
                            cryptography hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and
                            transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).
                            A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series
                            of immutable records of data that is managed by a cluster of
                            computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of
                            data (i.e. block) is secured and bound to each other using
                            cryptographic principles (i.e. chain).</p><br>

                            <p><b>“Blocks”</b> on the blockchain are made up of digital pieces of information.
                                Specifically have three parts.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Blocks store information about transactions like the date, time, and dollar
                                        amount of your most recent purchase from Amazon.</li>
                                    <li>Blocks store information about who is participating in transactions. A block
                                        for your splurge purchase from Amazon would record your name along with
                                        Amazon.com, Inc. Instead of using your actual name, your purchase is
                                        recorded without any identifying information using a unique “digital
                                        signature,” sort of like a username.</li>
                                    <li>Blocks store information that distinguishes them from other blocks. Much
                                        like you and I have names to distinguish us from one another, each block
                                        stores a unique code called a “hash” that allows us to tell it apart from every
                                        other block.
                                        </li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in
                                    1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. They wanted to implement a
                                    system where document timestamps could not be tampered with.</li>
                                <li>In 1992, Bayer, Haber, and Stornetta incorporated Merkle trees to the design,
                                    which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be
                                    collected into one block.</li>
                                <li>The first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people)
                                    known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an
                                    important way using the Hash cash like the method to add blocks to the chain
                                    without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party.</li>
                                <li>In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all
                                    transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (Gigabyte). In
                                    January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to
                                    January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size.</li>
                                <li>The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's
                                    original paper but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain,
                                    by 2016.
                                    </li>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Decentralization</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> In a decentralized system the information is not stored by one single entity. In fact,
                                        everyone in the network owns the information.</li>
                                        <li> In a decentralized network ,if you wanted to interact with your friend then you can
                                            do so directly without going through a third party. That was the main ideology behind
                                            Bitcoins. You and only you alone are in charge of your money. You can send your
                                            money to anyone you want without having to go through a bank</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>Transparency</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>One of the most interesting and misunderstood concepts in blockchain technology
                                        is “transparency.” Some people say that blockchain gives you privacy while some say
                                        that it is transparent. Why do you think that happens?</li>
                                        <li>A person’s identity is hidden via complex cryptography and represented only by
                                            their public address. So, if you were to look up a person’s transaction history, you will
                                            not see “Bob sent 1 BTC” instead you will see
                                            “1MF1bhsFLkBzzz9vpFYEmvwT2TbyCt7NZJ sent 1 BTC”.</li>
                                            <li>So, while the person’s real identity is secure, you will still see all the transactions that
                                                were done by their public address. This level of transparency has never existed before
                                                within a financial system. It adds that extra, and much needed, level of accountability
                                                which is required by some of these biggest institutions.
                                                </li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Immutability, in the context of the blockchain, means that once something has been
                                        entered into the blockchain, it cannot be tampered with.
                                        </li>
                                        <li> The reason why the blockchain gets this property is that of the cryptographic hash
                                            function.
                                            </li>
                                            <li> In simple terms, hashing means taking an input string of any length and giving out an
                                                output of a fixed length.
                                                </li>

<h3><b>What is Cloud Computing?</b></h3><br>
<p><b>Cloud Computing </b>means  of networking remote
  servers that are hosted on the
  Internet. Rather than storing
  and processing data on a local
  server, or a PC’s hard drive.</p><br>
  <p><b>Cloud</b> is a model of computing where servers,
    networks, storage, development tools, and even
    applications (apps) are enabled through the internet.</p><hr>
    <br>
    <h3><b>Types of Cloud Infrastructure</b></h3>
    <br>
  <ul>
    <b><h4><li>Private Cloud</li></h4></b>
    <p>•This cloud model is great for organizations concerned about
      sharing resources on a public cloud. It is implemented on
      servers owned and maintained by the organization and
      accessed over the internet or through a private internal
      network.</p>
      <b><h4><li>Hybrid Cloud</li></h4></b>
      <p>•Combination of public cloud and private
        cloud, frequently in combination with some
        on-premise infrastructure. It could also
        combine a public cloud with another public
        cloud (multicloud).</p>
  </ul><hr>
  <br><br>
  <h3><b>Service Categories</b></h3>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <b><h4><li>Software as a Service(SaaS)</li></h4></b>
    <p>• SaaS is the most commonly used cloud application service
      and is becoming a dominant way for organizations to access
      software applications.
      </p><br>
      <b><h4><li>Platform as a Sevice(Paas)</li></h4></b>
      <p>• PaaS is a popular choice for businesses who want to create
        unique applications without making major financial
        investments.</p><br>
        <b><h4><li>Infrastructure as a Service(Iaas)</li></h4></b>
        <p>• IaaS is the simplest option for businesses. With IaaS, an
          organization migrates its hardware—renting servers and
          data storage in the cloud rather than purchasing and
          maintaining its own infrastructure</p>
  </ul><hr><br><br>
  <h3><b>Advantages of Cloud Computing</b></h3>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <b><h4><li>Managed by Experts</li></h4></b><br>
    <b><h4><li>Secure Environment</li></h4></b><br>
    <b><h4><li>Scalable/Elastic Services</li></h4></b><br>
    <b><h4><li>Accessible from Anywhere</li></h4></b>
  </ul><hr><br><br>

  <h2><b>What is Quantum Computing</b></h2>
  <br>
  <p><b>Quantum Computing </b>is a multidisciplinary field comprising aspects of computer
    science, physics, and mathematics that utilizes quantum
    mechanics to solve complex problems faster than on
    classical computers.</p><hr><br>

    <h3><b>Advantages of Cloud Computing</b></h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <b><h5><li>Speed</li></h5></b>
      <p>Quantum computers can solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For example, factoring large numbers, which is a fundamental component of many encryption algorithms, can be solved much faster using quantum computers than classical computers.</p>
    <b><h5><li>Efficiency</li></h5></b>
    <p>Quantum computers are more efficient than classical computers in terms of memory usage and processing power. They can store and process vast amounts of information simultaneously, which makes them ideal for solving complex problems.</p>
    <b><h5><li>Parallel Processing</li></h5></b>
    <p>Quantum computers can perform multiple operations simultaneously, which means they can solve multiple problems at the same time. This allows for faster computation and increased efficiency.</p>
    <b><h5><li>Security</li></h5></b>

<h3><b>History of Computer Vision</b></h3><br>
<ul>
  <li><b>The history of computer vision can be traced back to the mid-20th century, when researchers began exploring the possibilities of using computers to interpret visual data. In 1959, psychologist J.C.R. Licklider proposed the idea of a "man-computer symbiosis" in which humans and computers would work together to solve complex problems. This idea laid the foundation for the development of artificial intelligence and computer vision.</b></li><br>

  <li><b>In the 1960s and 1970s, researchers began developing algorithms for image processing and analysis. These early algorithms focused on simple tasks, such as edge detection and object recognition. In 1966, MIT researcher Marvin Minsky wrote a seminal paper on the topic of computer vision, in which he outlined some of the challenges that needed to be addressed in order to develop machines that could "see" like humans.</b></li><br>
  <li><b>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, computer vision continued to evolve, with researchers developing more sophisticated algorithms for tasks such as image recognition, object tracking, and scene reconstruction. In the 1990s, the introduction of deep learning techniques, which use neural networks to process visual data, led to significant advancements in the field.</b></li><br>
  <li><b>In recent years, computer vision has become increasingly important in fields such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and facial recognition. Today, computer vision is a rapidly growing field, with researchers continuing to push the boundaries of what machines are capable of seeing and understanding.</b></li><br>

<h3><b>What is Embedded System?</b></h3><br>
<p><b>Embedded System </b>is  a controller with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often
  with real-time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including
  hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems control many devices in common use
  today. Ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors manufactured are used in embedded systems.</p>
  <p>Modern embedded systems are often based on microcontrollers (i.e. microprocessors with
    integrated memory and peripheral interfaces), but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips
    for memory and peripheral interface circuits) are also common, especially in more complex
    systems. In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general-purpose to those
    specialized in a certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand.
    A common standard class of dedicated processors is the digital signal processor (DSP).

      <h1 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft"><span><b>Cyber Security</b></span></h1><br><hr>

      <h3 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp"><b>What is Cyber Security?</b></h3>
      <p>It is the protection of computer systems from the theft of or damage to their hardware, software,
        or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.</p>
        <p>The field is becoming more important due to increased reliance on computer systems, the
          Internet and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth
          of smart devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the
          Internet of Things. Due to its complexity, both in terms of politics and technology, cybersecurity
          is also one of the major challenges in the contemporary world.</p>
          <p>Cybersecurity is often confused with information security but it focuses on protecting computer
            systems from unauthorized access or being otherwise damaged or made inaccessible. Information
            security is a broader category that looks to protect all information assets, whether in hard copy or
            in digital form</p>
            <p>The term cybercrime is used to describe an unlawful activity in which computer or computing
              devices such as smartphones, tablets, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), etc. which are standalone or a part of a network are used as a tool or/and target of criminal activity. It is often
              committed by the people of destructive and criminal mindset either for revenge, greed or
              134
              adventure. Combating this is a multi-disciplinary affair that spans hardware and software through
              to policy and people all of it aimed at both preventing cybercrimes occurring in the first place, and
              minimizing its impact when it does. </p>
  
              <hr><br>
  
  <h3><b>Cybersecurity Measures</b></h3><br>
  <h5>The following are some security measures to be taken to prevent cybercrimes:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Staff Awareness traing - </b> Human error is the leading cause of data breaches, so you
    need to equip staff with the knowledge to deal with the threats they face. Training courses
    will show staff how security threats affect them and help them apply best-practice advice
    to real-world situations.</li><br>
    <li><b>Application security - </b> H- Web application vulnerabilities are a common point of intrusion
      for cybercriminals. As applications play an increasingly critical role in business, it is vital
      to focus on web application security.</li><br>
      <li><b>Network security - </b> Network security is the process of protecting the usability and
        integrity of your network and data. This is achieved by conducting a network penetration
        test, which scans your network for vulnerabilities and security issues.</li><br>
        <li><b>Leadership commitment - </b> Human error is the leading cause of data breaches, so you
          need to equip staff with the knowledge to deal with the threats they face. Training courses
          will show staff how security threats affect them and help them apply best-practice advice
          to real-world situationsLeadership commitment is the key to cyber resilience.
          Without it, it is very difficult to establish or enforce effective processes. Top management
          must be prepared to invest in appropriate cybersecurity resources, such as awareness
          training.
        </li><br>
          <li><b>Password management - </b> Almost half of the UK population uses ‘password’, ‘123456’
            or ‘qwerty’ as their password. You should implement a password management policy that
            provides guidance to ensure staff create strong passwords and keep them secure.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h3><b>Types of Cybersecurity Threats</b></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Ransomware -</b> It is a type of malicious software. It is designed to extort money by
      blocking access to files or the computer system until the ransom is paid. Paying the ransom
      does not guarantee that the files will be recovered or the system restored.</li><br>
      <li><b>Malware -</b>It is a type of software designed to gain unauthorized access or to cause damage
        to a computer.</li><br>
        <li><b>Social Engineering -</b> It is a tactic that adversaries use to trick you into revealing sensitive
          information. They can solicit a monetary payment or gain access to your confidential data.
          Social engineering can be combined with any of the threats listed above to make you more
          likely to click on links, download malware, or trust a malicious source.</li>
          <li><b>Phishing</b>- it is the practice of sending fraudulent emails that resemble emails from
            reputable sources. The aim is to steal sensitive data like credit card numbers and login
            information. It’s the most common type of cyber-attack. You can help protect yourself
            through education or a technology solution that filters malicious emails.</li>
  </ul>
