        <h3 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp"><b><span>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? <span style="color : black;"></i></span></b><br></h3>
    
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence.
            Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", or “the ability to learn
            and solve problems” hence Artificial Intelligence means "a man-made thinking power."
            So, we can define Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the branch of computer science by which we can
            create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, think like humans, and able to make decisions.
            Intelligence, as we know, is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge. Knowledge is the
            information acquired through experience. Experience is the knowledge gained through exposure (training).
            Summing the terms up, we get artificial intelligence as the “copy of something natural (i.e., human
            beings) <em>‘WHO’</em> is capable of acquiring and applying the information it has gained
            through exposure.”
            Artificial Intelligence exists when a machine can have human-based skills such as learning,
            reasoning, and solving problems with Artificial Intelligence you do not need to preprogram a machine to
            do some work, despite that you can create a machine with programmed algorithms which can work with
            own intelligence.
            Intelligence is composed of:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reasoning</li>
        <li>Learning</li>
        <li>Problem Solving</li>
        <li>Perception</li>
        <li>Linguistic Intelligence</li>

    </ul>

        <h3><b>History Of AI</b></h3><hr>
        <p><b>A. Maturation of Artificial Intelligence (1943-1952)</b></p>
            <ul>
    
                <li>The year 1943: The first work which is now recognized as AI was done by Warren McCulloch and Walter pits in 1943. They proposed a model of artificial neurons.</li>
                <li>The year 1949: Donald Hebb demonstrated an updating rule for modifying the connection strength between neurons. His rule is now called Hebbian learning.</li>
                <li>The year 1950: The Alan Turing who was an English mathematician and pioneered Machine learning in 1950. Alan Turing publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" in which he proposed a test. The test can check the machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to human intelligence, called a Turing test.</li>
    
            </ul>
            <p><b>B. The birth of Artificial Intelligence (1952-1956)</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The year 1955: An Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon created the "first artificial intelligence program" Which was named "Logic Theorist". This program had proved 38 of 52 Mathematics theorems, and find new and more elegant proofs for some theorems.</li>
                    <li>The year 1956: The word "Artificial Intelligence" first adopted by American Computer scientist John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference. For the first time, AI coined as an academic field. At that time high-level computer languages such as FORTRAN, LISP, or COBOL were invented. And the
                        enthusiasm for AI was very high at that time.
                        </li>
    
                </ul>
            <p><b>C. The golden years-Early enthusiasm (1956-1974)</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The year 1966: The researchers emphasized developing algorithms that can solve mathematical problems. Joseph Weizenbaum created the first chatbot in 1966, which was named as ELIZA.</li>
                    <li>The year 1972: The first intelligent humanoid robot was built in Japan which was named
                        WABOT-1.
                        </li>
            
                </ul> 
            <p><b>D. The first AI winter (1974-1980)</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The duration between the years 1974 to 1980 was the first AI winter duration. AI winter refers to the time period where computer scientists dealt with a severe shortage of funding from the government for AI researches.</li>
                    <li>During AI winters, an interest in publicity on artificial intelligence was decreased.
                    </li>
    
                </ul>    
            <p><b>E. A boom of AI (1980-1987)</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The year 1980: After AI winter duration, AI came back with "Expert System". Expert systems were programmed that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert.</li>
                    <li>In the Year 1980, the first national conference of the American Association of Artificial Intelligence was held at Stanford University.</li>
    
                </ul>
            </ul>    
            <p><b>F. The second AI winter (1987-1993)</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The duration between the years 1987 to 1993 was the second AI Winter duration.</li>
                    <li>Again, Investors and government stopped in funding for AI research due to high cost but not efficient results. The expert system such as XCON was very cost-effective.
                    </li>
    
                </ul>
            </ul>    
            <p><b>G. The emergence of intelligent agents (1993-2011)</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The year 1997: In the year 1997, IBM Deep Blue beats world chess champion, Gary Kasparov, and became the first computer to beat a world chess champion.</li>
                    <li>The year 2002: for the first time, AI entered the home in the form of Roomba, a vacuum cleaner.</li>
    
                </ul>
            <p><b>H. Deep learning, big data and artificial general intelligence (2011-present)</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The year 2011: In the year 2011, IBM's Watson won jeopardy, a quiz show, where it had to solve complex questions as well as riddles. Watson had proved that it could understand natural language and can solve tricky questions quickly.</li>
                    <li> The year 2012: Google has launched an Android app feature "Google now", which was able to provide information to the user as a prediction.</li>
                    <li>The year 2014: In the year 2014, Chatbot "Eugene Goostman" won a competition in the infamous "Turing test".</li>
                    <li>The year 2018: The "Project Debater" from IBM debated on complex topics with two master debaters and also performed extremely well.</li>
                    <li> Google has demonstrated an AI program "Duplex" which was a virtual assistant and which had
                        taken hairdresser appointment on call, and the lady on the other side didn't notice that she was talking with the machine.
                        Now AI has developed to a remarkable level. The concept of Deep learning, big data, and data science are now trending like a boom. Nowadays companies like Google, Facebook, IBM, and Amazon are working with AI and creating amazing devices. The future of Artificial Intelligence is inspiring and will come with high intelligence.</li>

            <p>Artificial Intelligence is not just a part of computer science even it's so vast and requires lots of
        other factors that can contribute to it. To create the AI-first we should know that how intelligence is
        composed, so Intelligence is an intangible part of our brain which is a combination of Reasoning, learning,
        problem-solving, perception, language understanding, etc.
        To achieve the above factors for a machine or software Artificial Intelligence requires the following
        disciplines:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mathematics</li>
        <li>Biology</li>
        <li>Psychology</li>
        <li>Sociology</li>
        <li>Computer Science</li>
        <li>Neurons Study</li>
        <li>Statistics</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 2em; color:(#e66465, #9198e5)"><b><span>Levels of AI<span style="color : black;"></span></b><br></p><hr>
    
    <p><em><b>Stage 1 – Rule-Based Systems</b></em></p>
        <li>The most common uses of AI today fit in this bracket, covering everything from business software
        (Robotic Process Automation) and domestic appliances to aircraft autopilots.</li><br>
    
    <p><em><b>Stage 2 – Context Awareness and Retention</b></em></p>
        <li>Algorithms that develop information about the specific domain they are being applied in. They
        are trained on the knowledge and experience of the best humans, and their knowledge base can be updated
        as new situations and queries arise. Well, known applications of this level are chatbots and “roboadvisors”.</li><br>
    
    <p><em><b>Stage 3 – Domain-Specific Expertise</b></em></p>
        <li>Going beyond the capability of humans, these systems build up expertise in a specific context
        taking in massive volumes of information which they can use for decision making. Successful use cases
        have been seen in cancer diagnosis and the well-known Google Deepmind’s AlphaGo. Currently, this type
        is limited to one domain only would forget all it knows about that domain if you started to teach it something
        else.</li><br>
    
    <p><em><b>Stage 4 – Reasoning Machines</b></em></p>
        <li>These algorithms have some ability to attribute mental states to themselves and others – they
        have a sense of beliefs, intentions, knowledge, and how their own logic works. This means they could
        reason or negotiate with humans and other machines. At the moment these algorithms are still in
        development, however, commercial applications are expected within the next few years.</li><br>
    
    <p><em><b>Stage 5 – Self Aware Systems / Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</b></em></p>
        <li>These systems have human-like intelligence – the most commonly portrayed AI in media –
        however, no such use is in evidence today. It is the goal of many working in AI and some believe it could
        be realized already from 2024.</li><br>
    
    <p><em><b>Stage 6 – Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)</b></em></p>
        <li>AI algorithms can outsmart even the most intelligent humans in every domain. Logically it is
        difficult for humans to articulate what the capabilities might be, yet we would hope examples would include
        solving problems we have failed to so far, such as world hunger and dangerous environmental change.
        Views vary as to when and whether such a capability could even be possible, yet there a few experts who
        claim it can be realized by 2029. Fiction has tackled this idea for a long time, for example in the film Ex
        Machina or Terminator.
        </li><br>
    
    <p><em><b>Stage 7 – Singularity and Transcendence</b></em></p>
        <li>This is the idea that development provided by ASI (Stage 6) leads to a massive expansion in
        human capability. Human augmentation could connect our brains to each other and to a future successor of
        the current internet, creating a “hive mind” that shares ideas, solves problems collectively, and even gives
        others access to our dreams as observers or participants. Pushing this idea further, we might go beyond the
        limits of the human body and connect to other forms of intelligence on the planet – animals, plants, weather
        systems, and the natural environment. Some proponents of singularity such as Ray Kurzweil, Google’s
        Director of Engineering, suggest we could see it happen by 2045 as a result of exponential rates of progress
        across a range of science and technology disciplines. The other side of the fence argues that singularity is
        impossible and human consciousness could never be digitized.</li><br>
